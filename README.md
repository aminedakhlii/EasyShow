# Easyshow 1.0

# A software of screen sharing made for universities written in C programming.
 

EasyShow is a plateform I made as my freshman year project for students and teachers allowing students to share their screens to the datashow throughout the teacher's computer wirelessly. 

it consists of a friendly GUI made with GTK3 making the interactions as easy as possible,
uses SQLITE3,
uses ffmpeg to transfer encoded live screen recording,
uses Apache2 in server side to handle the traffic,

works only for Linux

Requirements:

CURL-lib
FFMPEG in the path 
SQLITE3-lib 
GTK3.0 lib

EasyShow is a plateform I made as my freshman year project allowing students to share their screens to the datashow throughout the teacher's computer wirelessly. 

the rep consists of 3 different programs : one for the student , one for teacher and one for the uni server.

works only for Linux

Requirements:
Cmake
Apache2 server
CURL-lib
FFMPEG in the path

#you can run it by cloning one of the reps then 'mkdir build' , 'cd build' , 'cmake ..' , 'make'
